# Smart Chair

A smart chair project using Arduino to enhance seating experience with sensors and automation.

## Description

This project aims to create an intelligent chair that can detect occupancy, adjust settings, or provide feedback based on user interaction. The current implementation includes basic setup for Arduino-based control.

## Features

- Occupancy detection
- Automated adjustments (to be implemented)
- Sensor integration

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Sensors (to be specified based on implementation)
- Actuators or displays as needed

## Wiring

Refer to the wiring diagrams:
- [Fritzing file](wiring/Wiring.fzz)
- [Wiring diagram image](wiring/Wiring.png)

## Software Setup

1. Install Arduino IDE
2. Open `source/SmartChair/SmartChair.ino`
3. Select the appropriate board and port
4. Upload the code
